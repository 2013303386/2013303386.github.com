The biomedical text mining research team is focused on the development of artificial intelligence algorithms based on Natural Language Processing and
bioinformatics. We are committed to constructing unstructured, massive biomedical and clinical data into a structured biomedical knowledge map.
Research areas: the construction and analysis of Natural Language Processing (information extraction, text representation),
biomedical text mining, and knowledge map (semantic web). Research methods: deep learning, semantic analysis,
machine learning. Applications: biomedical, social media.
