Efficient data retrieval becomes increasingly crucial in the era of Big
Data. Within the data, around 80%~90% potentially useful information is
presented in unstructured form, such as texts etc. <br />
The biomedical semantic understanding group(BioSun) is led by Professor <a href="http://www.chenli.group/member/">Chen Li</a> and focuses on designing state-of-the-art
algorithms of Natural Language Processing and artificial intelligent
methods of bioinformatics to achieve automated knowledge discovery from
vast amount texts and images.
In lay words, we teach computers to understand texts and be able to
think like human. <br />
